# Simon Game

The idea behind this project is to make a Simon Game for the second milestone project.
This is a basic game that you can play and test your memory with.

The game is designed to select random colored blocks and highlight them for a short period of time, 
the user will have to repeat the same moves afterwards which gets difficult after some time, since you have to remember the correct order.

# UX

The game itself will only start once the user (player) clicks to check the "ON/OFF" button, then procceeds to click on the "START" button located in the middle of the Simon Game platform.
Once "START" has been activated, the game will begin by flashing and highlighting one of the four different colored buttons.
If the user clicks on the correct button, the game will go on to the next level and continue until level 20 which is the last level. Victory is only granted once 20 levels have been cleared.

The game will let the user try to get the right order of flashes endlessly, unless the "STRICT" button has been activated. If activated and if the user then fails to match the flashes, it
will make the game reset and get back to level 1.
